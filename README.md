# 3D Portfolio Monorepo

This repository contains my 3D portfolio project, built with Next.js and React, plus a separate desktop-style app.

- **Web app:** `apps/web` – the 3D portfolio at [abeihhamani.vercel.app](https://abeihhamani.vercel.app)
- **Desktop app:** `apps/desktop` – a Next.js desktop-style client used for local development and experiments

The web app features an interactive 3D bedroom scene with a retro computer. Users can orbit around the room, click to “start,” and smoothly zoom into the computer screen, similar to a game intro.
